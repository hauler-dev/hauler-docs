For all supported customers of Rancher Government, under the umbrella of Rancher Government Carbide, there is included addon functionality within `Hauler`.

`Hauler` has the the ability to reference `Collections` from various registeries, including the `Carbide Secured Registry (CSR)`.

To better understand this workflow, `Hauler` is built to allow operators to fetch, store, package, and distribute various artifacts, but most operators may be unsure of what to fetch, store, package, and distribute, and that is where our supported customers are able to leverage predefined manifests, known as `Collections`, via the `--products` flag, through the `Carbide Secured Registry (CSR)`, for all of Rancher Government products and solutions.

Please see the **[Carbide Documentation](http://docs.ranchercarbide.dev)** for easily fetching, packing, and distributing Carbide with the `hauler store sync --products <product>=<product-version>`. Please know that we are actively working to improve this workflow and your feedback is appreciated!
